                                <p>The motivation for choosing this urban object is because of an ACL torn relapse happened to me in 2023. The inevitability of using an accessible built environment informs me of the “friction” that people with mobility issues face at getting access to university facilities.</p>

Also, for most of the time in a day (8 am to 9 pm), this entrance has high foot traffic so for people having trouble reaching the card reader, it is usually not a long wait until a nice person holds the door for them.</p>
                            <p>The lesson is, a quantified system cannot reflect all the truth, as human factors add a significant variable to it. For the next steps, I gathered some academic evidence for a quantified system describing accesibility. Using that as a capstone, I filed a document to the university about the extant issue on inconvenience that people with disabilities might still face when trying to access university properties. </p>
