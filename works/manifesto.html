                    <p>We plan to target P.P.P - Parents, pastors, and principals. They represent high-value targets for our rhetoric because of their position as community leaders, invested in the education and success of children (their own children, in the case of parents). This means that they have the potential to mobilize support, both financially, electorally, and socially, to progress our agenda.</p>

                    <p>We plan to gain the support of these key stakeholders by placing pamphlets and manifesto materials in schools, and churches, and striving to get them into the hands and eyes of parents of school children as well. From there, our ‘ask’ will be for these key figures to disseminate our message within their communities, using the authority they hold. This will then lead to fundraising opportunities and electoral/political support for our agenda, which in turn will enable us to put the D.A.R.T. plan into action and set our steps for architecting an egalitarian metropolis into motion.</p>

                    <p>Is your child able to get to school safely and on time? Are the children in your communities, your schools and your churches, able to get to school safely and on time? 86% of schoolchildren in Detroit don’t have access to a bus to take them to school. This leads to kids taking expensive, slow, and potentially dangerous public transportation. Here at D.A.R.T., we believe every kid should be able to get to school quickly, easily, and safely. Your children, and the children in your communities, are the future of Detroit. Getting them good access to quality education is the most important thing we can do to lift Detroit into a better future. Our platform centers providing kids with reliable transportation to and from school.
