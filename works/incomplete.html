                    <p>The Incomplete City project is designed around the learning of urban systems and how elements interact with each other. After finishing our <a target="_blank" href="https://urbantechnology.substack.com/p/urban-technology-at-university-of-190" class="link hoverAnimation">Chicago field trip</a>, the class was divided into groups, each facing a random stakeholder population. Groups were tasked to create a paper city for their population with isometric elements sketched based on our observations.</p>

They soon became some of the most welcomed props to add to the city for the concept of mixed-use housing and the creation of a comfy outdoor lifestyle.</p>

                        <li><p>The colors show the intensity of the data by using cooler colors for low traffic and warmer colors for high traffic, which is a perceptive norm of "temperature" as density. </li>

                    <p>Our tooltip is an interaction element implemented to give further details on data of different districts.

                    <p>We were only allowed a month of work time to finish this project - which is way too short to fully implement everything we want to do. As a result, we had to compromise a few features when prioritizing certain features over the other to create an interactive map where user follows a story line.</p>
                    <p>We still plan on editing this project in the future in the following aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Better Zoom feature - user can zoom in at our current version but it is a little wonky</li>
                        <li><p>Optimized tooltip feature - the current one has a ~0.5s delay to find and display the data</li>
                        <li><p>Click changes legend when switching from outgoing to incoming</li>
                        <li><p>Add a year slider for the user to see information in a time span</p></li>
