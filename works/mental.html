                    <p>During the topic discovery stage of the project, we aim to find an interactive system for accessing and using public services or spaces that has space for improvement. To determine the specific interface for improvement, we used the following methods: </p>
                    <ul style="font-size: 20px">
                        <li><b>Secondary research:</b> We broadly searched for resources online for news articles, citizen complaints, and research reports.</li>
                        <li><b>Preliminary ethnography:</b> We used the service and asked questions to other users about the accessibility of the system. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Eventually, we determined the domain of interactive system to improve - <b>Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Service at U of M</b>, a system that offers clinical services to students like mental health therapy free of cost. However, the current system can be a <b>time-consuming and confusing process</b> for students learning about and navigating the resources on campus, further <b>demotivating</b> students from securing the care that they need.</p>
